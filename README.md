Little iPad App that creates histograms of music as described in the paper here (http://subs.emis.de/LNI/Proceedings/Proceedings26/article635.html)


Also serves as an example project to show off some of Apple's `Accelerate.framework`.
The focus here lies on using the FFT and other vDSP functions.

There is also a little benchmark included.
The project is kind of old, I only modernized it for the purposes of the presentation about the framework.
I'm aware of the shortcomings code wise. Maybe I'll improve upon that, but feel free to take matters into your own hands, raise issues, pull requests etc.
